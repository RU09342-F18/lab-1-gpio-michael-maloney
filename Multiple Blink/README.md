## README
The multiple blink codes added to this folder both light up LEDs at varying rates.  The purpose of the code is to have two onboard LEDs blink repeatedly with 50% duty cycles at different rates.  For example, one LED would be turning on and off at 1Hz while the other is doing the same at 22Hz.  Ultimately the challenge is to find a way to delay two separate outputs equally and concisely. 

The two prorams in this folder run on almost entirely the same code.  After the include statment and main function are added, the watchdog timer is turned off.  PxSEL functions are then set to 0 for I/O control of the pins that are used.  The PxDIR of these pins are then set to 1 to tell the processor that these pins are going to be output.  Next, an integer i is set to 0 and an infinite while loop is created.  Two if statements are created inside this while loop to check whether the integer i is a multiple of an arbitrary value or not.  This logic involves the modulus operator and a comparator to see if the outcome is 0 or not.  If the number is a multiple, then the XOR logic tells the pin to either turn the LED on or off.  The i is then incremented and the cycle continues until i is equal to the highest arbitrary value so that it does not overflow if left on.  This design only allows for a 50% duty cycle if the multiple value used in the if statements are 5 or a multiple of 5.
